## About

This project is a modern **portfolio website** fully built with **Next.js**, featuring a visual identity inspired by AI aesthetics, electronic circuits, and futuristic interfaces.

The goal is to offer a **smooth, animated, and engaging experience**, while preparing the foundation for **V2**, which will include an integrated conversational AI embodied by the avatar.
